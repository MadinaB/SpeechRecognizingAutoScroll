I hope that this Chrome extension will help you to automatically scroll your web pages by using only your voice.

The usage is very very simple. 

Just say:

'Scroll Up' - to scroll up;
'Scroll Down' - to scroll down;
'Be Fast' and 'Be Slow' - to adjust speed of scrolling;
'Stop' - to stop scrolling;


You can download this extension from Chrome Web Store:
