# SpeechRecognizingAutoScroll
Voice recognition-enabled Google Chrome Extension to automatically scroll your web pages.

I hope that this Chrome extension will help you to automatically scroll your web pages by using only your voice.

The usage is very very simple. 

Just say:
'Up' - to scroll up.
'Down' - to scroll down.
'Fast' and 'Slow' - to adjust speed of scrolling.
'Stop' - to stop scrolling.
